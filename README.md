# Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

This repository contains a customer segmentation project for Arvato Financial Services, focusing on analyzing customer demographics data using machine learning techniques.

## Installation

The project is written in Python 3.6, primarily using Jupyter Notebook. The required libraries are included in the Anaconda distribution, such as Pandas, Numpy, and scikit-learn.

Additional required libraries:
- xgboost
- pickle

You can install any missing libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install xgboost pickle
```

## Project Motivation

Customer segmentation is a process for targeting specific consumer groups based on shared characteristics. In this project, I analyze demographic data for a German mail-order company to:

1. Identify key differences between the company’s customers and the general population.
2. Provide actionable insights for marketing and business strategies.

To achieve this, I use both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. The project involves:

- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means clustering to segment customers into meaningful groups.
- **Supervised Learning**: Predictive models to differentiate between customers and non-customers based on key features.

Ultimately, this project aims to assist the company in refining its customer targeting strategies by uncovering useful patterns in customer behavior.

## Technical Overview

The following key concepts are implemented in the project:

- **Data Exploration & Cleansing**: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant data, and cleaning the dataset for analysis.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space and focus on the most important variables.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Performing unsupervised clustering to identify customer segments.
- **Supervised Learning**: Applying machine learning models (XGBoost) to predict customer membership in different segments.
- **Feature Importance**: Evaluating the most influential features contributing to model predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics, such as accuracy and precision, to optimize model output.
- **Kaggle Submission**: Scoring the final model and submitting results to the Kaggle competition for evaluation.

**Note**: The dataset used in this project is proprietary and cannot be shared due to privacy and confidentiality concerns.
