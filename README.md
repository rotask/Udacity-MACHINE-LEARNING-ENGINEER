# Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services
Customer Segmentation repository for Arvato Financial Services.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The project code was written in Python 3.6 using Jupyter Notebook. All programs and libraries that were used, including Pandas, Numpy, and scikit-learn, are part of the Anaconda suite.

Additional Libraries include:
xgboost, 
pickle

## Motivation

This project is about customer segmentation; the process of dividing consumers into groups based on common traits so that companies target each group suitably. It is related to demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany. Both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms are employed to distinguish mail-order customers from the general population.   

## Technical Overview <a name="files"></a>

Following concepts implemented and covered in detail within the notebook:
- Data Exploration & Cleansing 
- Dimensionality Reduction
- K-Means Clustering
- Supervised Learning
- Feature Importance
- Final Model Evaluation
- Scoring and submisstion to Kaggle

The data file of this project is not provided because of the sensitive and proprietary nature of the demographics data.
